Data Structure Laboratory Assignment
SET-I
1. Write a program to take a 10 element array as input and delete the 3rd and 6th element.
Now print the 5th element of the resulting array.
2. Write a program to reverse a list of integers.
3. Write a program to add two sparse polynomials.
4. Write a program to evaluate sparse polynomial.
5. Write a polynomial to multiply two sparse polynomials.
6. Take two large numbers as input and add them. (Large no means that the noâ€™s does not
fall within the range of integer or long int).
7. Write a program to add two sparse matrixes.
8. Write a program to find number of non-zero elements in each row of a sparse matrix.
9. Derive the formulae for index of one dimensional array in terms of indices of two
dimensional Arrays. To access an element in one dimensional array, use the indices from
two dimensional Arrays. In this way print the content of the one dimensional array.
